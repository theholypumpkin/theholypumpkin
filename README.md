- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @theholypumpkin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded systems, arduinos, and gerneral more low level close to the hardware develpment. I also link writing assembly and VHDL but I'm not very good at it at the moment.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning circuit-python and regular python as well as improving my C++ skills. 
Especially training a more object oriented programming aproach.
